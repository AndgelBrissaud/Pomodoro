<h1>Welcome to the Web-Based Pomodoro Timer!</h1>
<p></p>This web application is designed to help you boost productivity and manage your time effectively using the Pomodoro Technique. 
Whether you're a student, a professional, or anyone looking to improve focus and productivity, this timer can assist you in breaking your work into focused intervals.</p>

<h2>What is the Pomodoro Technique?</h2>
<p></p>The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. 
It involves breaking work into focused intervals, typically 25 minutes, called "Pomodoros," followed by short breaks, usually 5 minutes. 
After completing four Pomodoros, you take a longer break, usually 15-30 minutes. This technique is effective for maintaining focus, combating procrastination, and improving overall productivity.</p>
